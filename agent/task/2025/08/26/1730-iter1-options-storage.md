# Task: Iteration 1 â€” Options and Storage

## Summary

Implemented Options page with Base URL, Model, and API Key fields. Settings are saved and restored using chrome.storage.local.

## Observations

- Plain text storage is insecure (acceptable for MVP).
- Options page styling is minimal.

## Suggestions

- Later add encryption for API key.
- Add validation (e.g., URL format).
