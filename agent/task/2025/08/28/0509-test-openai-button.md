# Task: add Test OpenAI button

## Summary
- Added a test provider for OpenAI requests.
- Extended options page with **Test OpenAI** button and popup.
- Created mock and tests for provider scenarios.
- Documented component and flow for provider check.

## Observations
- NPM packages `openai` and `@teqfw/di` were unavailable in this environment, preventing tests from running locally.
