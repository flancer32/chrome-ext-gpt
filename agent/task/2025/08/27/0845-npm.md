# Task: Introduce npm and DI structure

## Summary
- Initialized npm setup and added first dependency `@teqfw/di`.
- Restructured `src/` into `html/`, `js/`, `js/di/`, `css/`, and `img/` folders.
- Implemented DI container and `SettingsRepo` service for Chrome storage.
- Updated options page to use the container and registered service.
- Added build and test scripts with a unit test for the container.

## Observations
- External registry access was restricted; a local stub for `@teqfw/di` was used.
- Build process copies sources into `dist/` for packaging.

## Suggestions
- Replace the stub DI package with the official release once registry access is available.
- Extend tests to cover additional services and UI logic.
